# About HEADACHE

This is an flutter-project created for the lecture "Mobile Computing and Internet of Things" at KIT in WS21/22.
It uses the gyro-sensors of ESense-Earables. <br/>
It is a game where you have to move your head in the direction displayed on the screen.
During the game rules are announced. A rule switches two directions.
The longer the game the more complicated it gets. <br/>
The headache after playing the game is guaranteed!
